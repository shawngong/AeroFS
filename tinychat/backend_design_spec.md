Here is where your spec/explanation to the tinychat backend developer goes.

I would request a post endpoint for me to send new posts to. The post body would
contain the content of the message. Cookies would be used to pass id and author
name. Timestamp would be calculated from the server.

A get request to get all the comments in the chat would be needed too. In the
same form as the sample data provided.

This is the only two endpoints we need for the basic requirements. It provides
a good base for future additions.
